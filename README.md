## ðŸ“‚ Rewrite a Python Script in Rust

This project involves rewriting an existing Python data processing script in the Rust programming language. The goal is to assess the improvements in terms of speed and resource usage achieved by moving from Python to Rust. The scripts are designed to process data from a SQLite database and display the results.

### 1. Take an existing Python script for data processing
We will use the Python script [main.py](https://github.com/nogibjj/IDS706_DataEngineering_BarbaraFlores_Miniproject8/blob/main/python/main.py) from previous tasks, which connects to an SQLite database named [WorldSmallDB.db](https://github.com/nogibjj/IDS706_DataEngineering_BarbaraFlores_Miniproject8/blob/main/data/WorldSmallDB.db) and executes various SQL queries. The primary purpose is to summarize the database and provide descriptive statistics about it.

### 2. Rewrite it in Rust

### 3. Highlight improvements in speed and resource usage
